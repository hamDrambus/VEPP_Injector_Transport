This programm requires C++ MINUIT v2 (not included in this .git)
The program aim to model charged beam beahavior in magnetic optical system in transport section, calculate some of its parameters (using experimental measurements) and supply all required interface (GUI) for control server of VEPP injector complex (BINP, Russia, Novosibirsk). At the moment only model is ready and under tests

It is the first version, before changing corr_object structure
Optic parameters should be also changed to be more realistic
At the moment method of calculating quadrupoles gradients via responce matrix fit is under seruios question
